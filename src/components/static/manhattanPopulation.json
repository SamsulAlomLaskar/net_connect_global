      "description": "The visualization you see here is a model of the dynamic population of Manhattan, block-by-block and hour-by-hour for a typical week in late Spring. The model is currently fixed to your local time. The population estimates are the result of a combination of US Census data and a geographic dispersion of calculated net inflows and outflows from subway stations, normalized to match population daytime and nighttime estimates provided by a study from NYU Wagner. You may exit the ‘Story’ mode at any time by selecting the ‘Visualization’ or ‘Statistics’ tabs in the header above. For more information, click ‘About’. To continue, click the arrows below.",

      "description": "While Manhattan is well-known for its concentration of culture, art, and economic sectors, the crown county of NYC is also unique for its concentration of people in a statistical sense. In addition to being the most-dense county in the US, Manhattan also lays claim to having the highest ratio of daytime-to-nighttime population anywhere in the country at nearly 2 to 1. While the 2010 US Census claims that 1.6 million reside in Manhattan, a study by NYU Wagner estimates the true overnight population is likely around 2 million people, and that this figure balloons to nearly 4 million people during the workday.",

The additional 25% represent an ever-present mix of workers and visitors. Subway activity suggests that this lower bound is likely approached overnight on Sunday around 2 am, just before the workweek begins. This “trough” of population is visualized here.",

Collectively, the island north of Central Park behaves much like the outer boroughs in that it is a daytime exporter, with an estimated decrease in population of about 20%. Conversely, the island below Central Park is a daytime importer, increasing its total population by over 3x against overnight estimates.",
